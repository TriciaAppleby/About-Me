        <h1>This Is All About Tricia Appleby</h1>
        <p> My name is Tricia Appleby. I am 35 years old, and
            married for 12 years. I have 2 boys, William age 9 and Connor age 6.
            I have 2 cats and a newly acquired crawdad.
            I have a degree in interior design so I have no backround in
            computers at all.</p>
